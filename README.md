# Address Intercept example UART-DMA

It is a example using of the [AddressIntercept technology](https://github.com/ser-mk/AddressIntercept "AddressIntercept technology")  to run microcontroller programm on host  PC. The AddressIntercept tool translates intercepted addresses in microcontroller to write and to read register.

 My test stand

 The green board is a Linux machine where ran a openOCD server.
 `You may run a openOCD server on host PC if use another USB JTAG/SWD adapter (example st-link, jlink, etc)`
 The blue board is a [bluepill](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=bluepill&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 "bluepill")
I connected Tx UART1 (PA9 pin) with Rx UART2 (PA3 pin) using the white wire.

My example will be to tune periphery of microcontroller, namely, UART1 UART2 and gpio led (PC13 pin). Then UART1 will send bytes and UART2 will recieve using DMA. Also blink led.
But we run the example program on host PC instead a microcontroller. Due to program are ran with pintool client, which intercept writing and reading  periphery address of microcontroller. And then pass this operation to openOCD server using command [mww and mdw](http://openocd.org/doc/html/General-Commands.html "mww and mdw").

Let's build and run it...

My host PC is Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit and test stand frome above (JTAG/SWD adapter and prepared STM32F103C8 (PA9 pin connected to PA3 pin).

–ê simple way:

1. Download [pintool v3.7](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool "pintool  v3.7") 
2. Unpack archive
3. cd pin-3.7-97619-g0d0c92f4f-gcc-linux/source/tools/
4. git clone git@github.com:ser-mk/AddressIntercept.git
5. cd AddressIntercept
6. make TARGET=obj-ia32 # If you have 64-bit system, need to install some 32-bit packets
7. git clone git@github.com:ser-mk/AddressIntercept-example-UART-DMA.git
8. cd AddressIntercept-example-UART-DMA
9. make
10. cd - # to  pin-3.7-97619-g0d0c92f4f-gcc-linux/source/tools/
11. mkfifo in.fifo out.fifo
12. python3.5m OCDclient.py -ip $IP_YOUR_OPENOCD_SERVER &
13. ../../../pin -t obj-ia32/addrIntercept.so -- AddressIntercept-example-UART-DMA/test.elf

and we'll have:
